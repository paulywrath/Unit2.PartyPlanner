// Create state to store fetched data.

// When the page loads, it fetches a list of events from an API and stores it in state. 

// Render a list of events from the data stored in state.
  // Grab what the list elements will appear inside
  // Create list element for each event in state
  // Put event data inside list element
  // Add them inside parent

// Each event is an object with details about the event. We have the option of using those details later.
